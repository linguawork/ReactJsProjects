# Getting Started with Create React App

To create a react project in JS:
```
npx create-react-app
```

cd to folder and install redux, react-redux (this is to bind the state of redux with the components)

```
npm i redux react-redux
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This is the continuation of REDUXJS project
I copied the files from the reduxjs project folder
