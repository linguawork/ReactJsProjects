# Getting Started with Create React App

To create a react project in JS:
```
npx create-react-app
```

cd to folder and install redux, react-redux (this is to bind the state of redux with the components)

```
npm i redux react-redux
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This is the continuation of REDUXJS project
I copied the files from the reduxjs project folder 
to extend the project here

In the project two reducer functions are used. The project is decomposed into components. 
Each reducer has its own file inside a common component folder: store. The store folder has its own index.js file to contain store, which is exported to the Provider inside main index.js file.
