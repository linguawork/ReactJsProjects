# Getting Started in the 4th part of reduxjs
REDUXJS4: The state will use redux thunk to work with async code. \
This is the continuation of REDUXJS3 project \
I copied the source files from the reduxjs3 folder 

```
npx create-react-app 
```

cd to folder and install redux modules:

1) The devtools are installed with:
```
npm i redux-devtools-extension
```

2) The redux-thunk module, which works with async code, is installed with:
```
npm i redux-thunk
```
3) The flag helps with deprecated dependencies:
```
--legacy-peer-deps
```


* This the whole command (to install node modules after cloning as well):
```
npm i redux react-redux redux-devtools-extension redux-thunk --legacy-peer-deps
```
