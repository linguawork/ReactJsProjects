    I want to ask, if curly brackets are used to include functions and variables? As in :       
        <>
            <h1>Hello {this.state.firstName} {this.state.lastName}</h1>

            <button onClick={()=>this.handleNameChange()}> Change Name</button>
        </>

ChatGPT
    Yes, you are correct! In JSX, curly braces {} are used to include JavaScript expressions, 
    functions, and variables within the markup. This allows you to dynamically render 
    content based on the values of variables or the result of function calls.

    In your example:

    jsx
        <>
            <h1>Hello {this.state.firstName} {this.state.lastName}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => this.handleNameChange()}>Change Name</button>
        </>
    {this.state.firstName} and {this.state.lastName} are expressions that evaluate to the 
    firstName and lastName properties of the component's state, respectively. These values 
    will be inserted into the rendered output.

    {() => this.handleNameChange()} is an arrow function used as an event handler for the 
    onClick event of the button. It will call the handleNameChange method when the button 
    is clicked.

    Using curly braces {} in JSX allows you to seamlessly integrate JavaScript logic into 
    your React components, making them dynamic and interactive.
