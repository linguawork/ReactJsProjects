Approach 4: Updating the state using its previous value.
We create an initial state count having a value of 0. The function updateState() 
increments the present value of the state by 1 whenever it is called. 
This time we use setState() method in an arrow function by passing prevState as a parameter.
 The current value of the state is accessed with prevState.stateName
  which gets incremented by 1 whenever we press the button. 
  This method is really useful when we are setting a value in the state in such a way 
  that it depends on its previous value. For example, 
  toggling a boolean (true/false) or incrementing/decrementing a number.
