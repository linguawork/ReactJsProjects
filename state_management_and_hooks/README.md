# React + Vite

The project is the combination of different components, that manage state either
in class components or in functional components. Classes and useState hook is used to manage the state in React. 

Besides state management, there are also components with other hooks:
useContext, useEffect

The project is created with Vite and is served at 
Local: http://localhost:5173/

```
npm create vite@latest my-vite-project
```

cd to folder:


```
npm i
npm run dev
```

All the components I imported from my other repo, which is my FrontEndLearningRoad. 


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
